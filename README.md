# WastedPotential_Code  

This repository contains all of the code for our application. The html used for our calendar interface is contained in the "website" folder. Our database communication capabilities are contained in index.js which can be seen on the main page of the repository.  
Our application is to be deployed locally. Therefore, there are a few steps a user must follow in order to run it:  
$\begin{itemize}
  \item Install mongo and node js 
  \item All the modules should be included in git, so no need to run npm install, if missing module for some reason, npm install it   
  \item Run command “node index.js” and you should see output of “hey hi the server started” which means you got it running  
  \item Visit http://localhost:8000/website/register.html to register an account or http://localhost:8000/website/login.html to login
\end{itemize}$
