# WastedPotential_Code  

This repository contains all of the code for our application. The html used for our calendar interface is contained in the "website" folder. Our database communication capabilities are contained in index.js which can be seen on the main page of the repository.  
Our application is to be deployed locally. Therefore, there are a few steps a user must follow in order to run it:  
* Install mongo and node js 
* All the modules should be included in git, so no need to run npm install, if missing module for some reason, npm install it  * Run command “node index.js” and you should see output of “hey hi the server started” which means you got it running  
* Visit http://localhost:8000/website/register.html to register an account or http://localhost:8000/website/login.html to login  

Team: Wasted Potential
We created a student calendar application. This app will run locally on someone's machine and help them schedule events, assignments, and classes. With our app, students will be able to input their preferred study times and assignments, and then have specific study periods scheduled for them. This will help students be more productive and complete their tasks in time. 
In the dashboard they'll be able to see a breakdown of the assignments and events they have that week, and in the calendar view they'll be able to see their whole month. After adding an assignment to their schedule, our application will prioritize the current list of assignments and fill in the student's preffered study times with work hours scheduled for inidividual assignments.
Events, assignment due dates, and assignment work times will all be different colors.

For instructions on how to run the application, head over to our code repository. More instructions will be in that README.
